# dnans.org Ansible Test Playground

# present state - completely broken, I'm mid-stream of a refactor of many things so this is currently a development branch

dnans is [gradyp's](https://www.gradyp.com) dev environment. this is purely a place to learn and play.

currently this is my Ansible playground where I'm exploring potential replacements for [snand.org's](https://snand.org) script based setup.

**disclaimer**:  
this repo is experimental and contains work-in-progress code.  it's not intended for public use, but if you find anything here useful, feel free...

## current focus

- ~~setting up a basic Ansible project structure.~~

  - managing system services.
  - setting up persistent mounts using UUIDs.
  - configuring SMB shares
- installing docker projects
- ~~traefik~~
 - cloudflare

## future enhancements

- versioning for .env and compose files
  - .env skipped if it exists, need logic for checking version or something in case of future change
