    <p>This site is a joke, built for one person: me. Back in the 1990s, I had a personal website hosted on a free platform, written entirely in notepad.exe. At the time, I couldn't believe I had made something that was on the actual internet for anyone to see. I had a web counter, joined web rings, and even hosted something called the Monkeypit (don’t ask unless you’re ready). It was my little corner of 90s paradise, now lost to time because archive.org never found it.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to today—I needed a simple static site for testing and figured I’d throw something together to avoid staring at an empty directory listing. I thought, "Why not let ChatGPT handle it?" I couldn’t believe how quickly it whipped up a retro site, and suddenly, nostalgia hit me like a truck. Why not go all the way? I couldn’t find the exact tiled wallpaper I wanted, so I asked GPT to make one.</p>

    <p>And now, here we are. Somehow, I’ve unintentionally recreated the bones of my very first website, and every bit of it—down to this paragraph—was generated by ChatGPT. Honestly, I can’t stop laughing.</p>
