# backup script for snand wordpress
#

#
# description:
# this script creates backups for snand's wordpress site, including wordpress files and the mariadb database . 
# it saves the files and database, along with a log, into one tar.gz archive in the backup directory.  
# itâ€™s meant to be run manually or via cron for automated backups, and logs both to console and a log file.  
# if anything goes wrong, it logs it and exits.  
# current setup is full backups, but we plan on getting fancier later (see enhancements)
#
# usage:
# run it manually or set up a cron job (example cron job for daily backups at 2 am):  
# 0 2 * * * /path/to/snandpress_backup.sh  
# 
# backup bundles everything into a single tar.gz file:
# - wordpress files (/var/www/html)  
# - mariadb database dump  
# - a log of the backup process  
# 
# enhancements (coming soon, probably):
# - **incremental/delta backups**: back up only changed files instead of everything  
# - **separate content and db backups**: db backed up daily, files backed up weekly  
# - **auto-prune old backups**: clean up old backups after X days or keep only the last Y backups  
# - **notifications**: get alerts when a backup succeeds or fails
