# snand wordpress docker compose project (work in progress)

this repository contains the **wordpress docker compose project** powering [snand.org](https://snand.org).

## introduction

this project is currently live, but still under active developmentâ€”expect things to be *fully broken* at any moment.  

the foundation is shaping up, but various mucking around is still in progress.  next steps include fixing permission issues and validating a working backup, restore, and migration method.  

## current status

the project is live, running via docker compose, but many pieces are still being built and refined.  for now, it functions as the wordpress base for snand.org, but more updates are coming soon.
