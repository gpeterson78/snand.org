# WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT FOR USE UNLESS YOU LIKE BROKEN THINGS
(but check back soon, snand is adding search)
---
## search.snand.org
based off the searxng docker image: https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker
snand.org uses traefik instead of caddy so this removes caddy from their default image and replaces it with traefik labels
